**Problem statement:**
I downloaded an opensourced dataset containing financial information of a dummy banking institution. My task was to find insights from the dataset for formulating financial products.

**Tool:**
I used the BI tool of Power BI for performing data wrangling, data modelling and ETL operations.

**Steps taken to execute the analysis:**
- I imported the dataset into Power Query of Power BI.
- I performed data wrangling operations to tackle null values, missing values and data-type mismatch.
- Then I utilized DAX formulas to create various metrics to trace the financial health of the bank.

**Observation**
- NPAs accounted for 14% of the loan applications.
- Junior employees had less EMI amount since they get longer duration to payoff the EMIs.
- Senior employees have higher EMI amount since they get shorter duration to payoff the EMIs.
- The EMI amoun increases expoentially for senior employees with more than a decade of work experience as they have very less time to payoff the EMI on time.
-  From the verified accounts:
    -  NPAs accounted for only 37.5% of the total verified accounts.
    -  Fully paid account constituted for 87.5% of total verified accounts.
